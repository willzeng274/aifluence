## üß© What AIFluence Does

At its core, AIFluence is a marketing automation engine powered by AI-generated personas. Users can initialize a virtual influencer by giving it a name, backstory, tone, goals, and preferred audience. From there, the system handles the entire content lifecycle:

- It generates reels and stories using multimodal models like **Veo 3** and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**.
- It schedules posts at your desired time.
- It directly publishes to **Instagram** via the official **Publishing API**.
- It builds a real-time digital identity and adapts based on user-defined objectives and "changes" to the persona's life

AIFluence supports two key use cases:
- **B2B**: Businesses can build persistent, custom brand ambassadors tailored to their market segment.
- **B2C**: Individual users or niche entrepreneurs can create lifestyle personas to explore passive-income opportunities‚Äîsimilar to dropshipping, but with content instead of products.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

**Frontend:**  
We used **Next.js** with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to build an immersive and highly interactive onboarding and dashboard experience. The frontend lets users walk through persona creation, view posting history, and trigger or modify post schedules.

**Backend Server:**  
Our API server was built using **FastAPI**. It handles influencer initialization, scheduling, and communication with third-party services. It uses a local **SQLite** database to persist influencer data, metadata, and scheduling information.

**Video & Media Generation:**  
The most critical layer of AIFluence is our media generation pipeline, which connects multiple AI models to simulate influencer behavior:
- **Veo 3 (Runway)**: Used for high-quality, scene-based reel generation.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Used for generating photorealistic persona imagery and thumbnails based on persona attributes.
- **MoviePy** + **PIL**: For assembling final videos with overlayed captions, transitions, and branding.
- **Transformers (HuggingFace)** and **GPT-4o**: Used to write captions, develop storytelling scripts, and maintain a coherent voice across time.

**Instagram Integration:**  
We used the official **Instagram Graph API** (Publishing) to automate reel and story uploads on behalf of the AI personas. The FastAPI backend handles login sessions, scheduling, and post automation.

## üß™ Architecture Overview

1. **User onboarding**: User creates an influencer by filling out a brief profile (name, image, tone, goals, etc.)
2. **Persona is initialized**: Back-end assigns growth logic, generation cadence, and target audience.
3. **Content pipeline triggers**: Stories and reels are generated using LLMs + Veo 3 based on persona goals and timelines.
4. **Auto-scheduling**: Content is slotted into a weekly schedule via FastAPI logic.
5. **Publishing**: Media is uploaded directly to Instagram with appropriate metadata (captions, hashtags, etc.)
6. **Analytics (MVP)**: The system tracks posting intervals, response rates, and growth curves.

## üí° Inspiration

Influencer marketing is booming, but it‚Äôs inefficient and expensive. Human influencers come with inconsistent availability, high costs, and limited scalability. We imagined a world where you could "design" an influencer that doesn't sleep, doesn't charge thousands per post, and aligns perfectly with your product or personal vision.

AIFluence was born from this thought‚Äîgiving creators and companies alike the tools to scale influence on demand.
